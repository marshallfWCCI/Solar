 Why Solar?
  Financial
   Future cost per kWh
    Solar panels are a hedge against rising power costs
    Shifting load to midday makes a huge difference
   Reimbursement per kWh
    AEP only pays us because *current* law requires them
    Large whole–house batteries hedge against this
    Shifting load to midday makes a huge difference
  Resiliency
   Climate change stresses our electric grid in many ways. Expect more blackouts.
    Solar panels are a hedge against needing to buy a generator
    Available power dependent upon cloud cover
   Critical–load sub–panel batteries are the most cost–effective approach.
    Full battery capacity rarely used
    Difficult to plan and install
  Ecological
   Solar panels are more efficient in large scale installations.
   However, the grid cannot handle massive electrification, e.g. if everyone had an EV.
